## Synopsis

This project was created as part of my Major Project. It contains both the server code (api) and front end code (ionic code) for Dynamic which is a musical social media app developed in a hybrid manner.

## Code Example

//TODO: Complete this section.
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

The motivation for completing this project was for me to use new technologies, specifically AngularJS to develop a hybrid app for my Major Project.

## Installation

Code can be ran after user has installed an ionic project. Back end (api) has to be placed on a PHP server.

## API Reference

Some API's have been created myself and can be found in the API folder.
External API's include: //TODO update list when necessary.

## Tests

Testing will be run using Jasmine.

## Contributors

Project has been developed solely by Sean Anderson.
