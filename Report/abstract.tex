The issue of the best way to develop mobile applications is a complex one. There are three different techniques for developing apps: native development, web based app development and hybrid apps. Hybrid apps combine techniques from both native and web based app development.

Through developing a social media app I have examined hybrid mobile app development whilst pondering whether they actually are plausible to developing apps in a native manner.

I found that hybrid apps are feasible alternatives to developing apps in a native manner for things rather trivial such as data input and output and storage, however from the research I carried out it appears that developing advanced graphics and games in hybrid apps is not currently a viable thing to do.
