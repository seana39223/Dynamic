The issue of the best way to develop mobile applications is a complex one. There are three different techniques for developing apps: native development, web based app development and hybrid apps. Hybrid apps combine techniques from both native and web based app development.

Through developing a social media app hybrid mobile app development was examined whilst pondering whether they actually are plausible to developing apps in a native manner. It was clear that there are quite a few disadvantages to hybrid development such as the developer not having full control over a device's native features such as the camera, and styling of the app can be rather tricky, where as styling in native iOS development through Xcode's story board is rather straightforward. 

There were multiple advantages to hybrid apps which was discovered such as that it takes a very short time to convert the app between different platforms and that because hybrid app's generally use web technologies most developers will find the different frameworks straightforward to pick up. 

User testing for this project suggests that the end users were happy with the app created and in terms of how the app performed they felt that it was similar to a hybrid app therefore it would be fair to conclude that hybrid mobile applications are feasible alternatives to native apps.
