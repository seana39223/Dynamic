\section{Design}
The ionic framework for developing mobile hybrid applications encourages the use of the Model View Controller (MVC) compound design pattern. MVC is something which is generally considered good practice within the software engineering industry and therefore the app was designed keeping that in mind.

The model of the app would be the database which is stored on the backend of the system. The view is the html files and the controllers are both the Angular JS controllers and the RESTful PHP API which I created.

\subsection{Overall Architecture}
Figure X shows the architecture as whole. Whilst figures X separates the model, view and controller.

Figure X (created using \url{https://www.lucidchart.com/}) illustrates that once a user has logged in they can access multiple different pages through the menu bar (menu.html). The only page which is restricted is the events.html page as only venue owners can access this page to create events. The register.html page can only be accessed through the login page as it is accessed when a user needs to create a new account to login.

\subsection{Some detailed design}
The following figure highlights the different relationships between the tables (model) for events.

Figure 2.2  is a UML diagram (created using \url{Created using https://www.lucidchart.com/}) which shows the appropriate relationships between the different tables in the database in relation to an event.

\subsection{User Interface}
In considering the music social network app it was decided that the name of the app would be Dynamic. Research into different social media sites was carried out and it was decided that blue would be the main colour used for the app, this is because blue is considered a relaxing colour and in terms of accessibility it is one of the most important colours.
\subsubsection{Schniderman Principles}
Figure X (created using \url {https://www.fluidui.com}) shows some UI mockups which were created.

\section{Experimental Methods}
As the purpose of the project was to determine whether hybrid apps are feasible alternatives to native apps tests had to be derived. User testing is key to this as it allows for general users (people who use apps on a regular basis) to give feedback about whether they think the hybrid app is as good as a native app, if not why not etc. Another key aspect to answering the question is comparing the resource usage on the device of the hybrid app to a standard app, this will include comparing things such as amount of RAM being used.

Finally ,during each story in the development process, it was considered whether using hybrid app technology was as challenging, more challenging or less challenging than developing using native app technologies.

\subsection{User Testing}
In establishing whether hybrid apps are feasible alternatives to native apps it was important to get general users thoughts about the app which had been produced. Within the development community there is a bit of a stigma associated towards hybrid mobile applications therefore in an attempt to remove bias the majority of people who fill in the questionnaires associated with the app will be lay people.

Whilst clearly it would be great to get a large amount of people to participate by filling in a questionnaire realistically only around 10 people were chosen. Before asking each individual questions, the project was explained to them.

The following questions were asked to each individual (a blank copy of the questions is in the apendix.)

\begin{enumerate}
\item On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being slowest and 10 being very fast in your opinion how quick is the app at processing the registration form?
\item On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being significantly slower than a native appm 5 being about the same time as a native app and 10 being significantly faster than a native app. In your opinion how quick is the app at processing the registration form?
\item On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being slowest and 10 being fast in your opinion how long does the process of uploading a profile picture take?
\item On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being significantly slower than a native app, 5 being about the same and 10 being very fast, faster than a native app. In your opinion how long does the process of uploading a new profile picture take?
\item On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being slowest and 10 being fast in your opinion how long does the process of viewing events and sorting them by using nearest events (GPS) take?
\item On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being significantly slower than a native app, 5 being about the same as a native app and 10 being very fast, faster than a native app in your opinion how long does the viewing events and sorting them by using nearest events (GPS) take?
\end{enumerate}
These questions were decided upon as they ensured that all of the stories which were relevant in terms of testing different elements of hybrid technologies can be tested.
