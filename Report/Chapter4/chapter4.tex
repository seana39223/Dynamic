\chapter{Testing and experimenting}

Detailed descriptions of every test case are definitely not what is required here. What is important is to show that you adopted a sensible strategy that was, in principle, capable of testing the system adequately even if you did not have the time to test the system fully.

Have you tested your system on ``real users''? For example, if your system is supposed to solve a problem for a business, then it would be appropriate to present your approach to involve the users in the testing process and to record the results that you obtained. Depending on the level of detail, it is likely that you would put any detailed results in an appendix.

The following sections indicate some areas you might include. Other sections may be more appropriate to your project. 

\section{Overall Approach to Testing and Experiments}

\section{Acceptance Testing}
A table was derived which broke down all of the stories into multiple different features. These features were then tested, and a comment was left if the test did not pass.

\begin{center} 
 \begin{tabular}{||c c c c||}  
 \hline
 Story & Feature Name & Pass/Fail & Comment \\
 \hline\hline
 Registration and Login & Register User Details &  Fail &  \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}} Users postcode \\ does not get\\ added properly \end{tabular} \\
 \hline
 Registration and Login & \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}Login with \\ previously created \\ account \end{tabular} & Pass &  Works as expected \\
 \hline
 Registration and Login & Logout & Fail & \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}} System appears to \\ logout okay however \\ it loads previous \\ users feed. \end{tabular} \\
 \hline
 Profile Page & \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}} Upload picture \\ from library \end{tabular}  &  Pass  & Works as expected  \\ 
 \hline
Profile Page & \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}Take picture \\using device's camera \\ and upload.\end{tabular} & Pass &  Works as expected  \\ 
\hline
Profile Page & Update bio & Pass & Works as expected \\
\hline 
Post System & User Posts & Pass &  \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}} User posts get \\ added to feed table \\ as expected. \end{tabular} \\
\hline

\hline

\hline

 \hline
 Search &  \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}} User can search \\ for nearby events \end{tabular} & Pass &  \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}} Uses device's GPS \\ correctly and compares \\ with events location \end{tabular} \\
 \hline

  \hline
   Search &  \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}} User can search \\ for events \\ which are happening \\ soon \end{tabular} & Pass &  \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}} Correctly sorts \\ events by dates  \end{tabular} \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

It is clear from Table 4.1 that in terms of acceptance testing some of the code contained bugs for example the logout system was not working properly. Once all of the issues in Table X had been addressed another table; Table Y was created, this goes through the tests which failed in Table X and evaluates whether they now pass.

\section{Unit tests}
It is important to unit test each of the functions within the controllers to make sure that the user of the app wont encounter any weird behaviour. The Jasmine and Karma frameworks were used for unit testing the app.  

\section{User Interface testing}
For a mobile app user interface testing is very important. As the user interface is essentially how the user natvigates around the front end and how they submit data to the back end. Whilst there is no simple automatic way to test the UI on a ionic application, a table was derived which shows all of the different buttons and navigation options to ensure that the UI worked as expected.

\begin{center} 
 \begin{tabular}{||c c c c||}  
 \hline
 Location & Button/Navigation & Pass/Fail & Comment \\
 \hline
 Login Screen & Register Button & Pass & \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}} Takes to registration \\ screen as expected. \end{tabular} \\
 \hline

 \hline
 Registration Screen & Return to Login Button & Pass & \begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}} App returns to \\ login screen on button \\ click. \end{tabular} \\

\section{User testing}
In terms of user testing the actual questions which were discussed in the experimental methods section (see Appendix X), all of the questions were measure on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 meaning that the user found the hybrid app fast and 1 meaning it was slow. table X shows the results.

\begin{center} 
 \begin{tabular}{||c c c c c c c||}  
 \hline
  \hline
 Participant & Q1 & Q2 & Q3 & Q4 & Q5 & Q6 \\
 \hline
 2 & 9 & 6 & 8 & 4 & 9 & 9 \\
 \hline
 3 & 10 & 9 & 9 & 4 & 8 & 4 \\
 \hline
 \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{center}

 Figure X gives a graphical representation of the results. 

 \section{Resource Usage}
 When considering if hybrid mobile application it is also important to consider how much of the devices resources the app is using. For comparison the resource usage of Facebook has also been listed.

 One of the main resources which was compared was the amount of CPU, as shown in Figure X when Facebook was looking for events it used 6\% where as when the hybrid app which was developed was also 6\%. It does need to be considered that Facebook is significantly larger than the hybrid app which was created consequently the hybrid app uses more CPU for less data than Facebook.
