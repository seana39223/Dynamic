\chapter{Testing and Experimenting}

Detailed descriptions of every test case are definitely not what is required here. What is important is to show that you adopted a sensible strategy that was, in principle, capable of testing the system adequately even if you did not have the time to test the system fully.

Have you tested your system on ``real users''? For example, if your system is supposed to solve a problem for a business, then it would be appropriate to present your approach to involve the users in the testing process and to record the results that you obtained. Depending on the level of detail, it is likely that you would put any detailed results in an appendix.

The following sections indicate some areas you might include. Other sections may be more appropriate to your project. 

\section{Overall Approach to Testing and Experiments}

\section{Automated Testing}

\subsection{Unit Tests}
It is important to unit test each of the functions within the controllers to make sure that the user of the app wont encounter any weird behaviour. The Jasmine and Karma frameworks were used for unit testing the app.  

\subsection{User Interface Testing}

\subsection{Stress Testing}

\subsection{Other types of testing}

\section{Integration Testing}

\section{User Testing}
